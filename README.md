# Software Engineer Portfolio

This portfolio contains notable contributions throughout my career as an Associate Software Engineer. Within the last year, I have gone through a great deal of growth, and have been given the opportunity to improve upon my knowledge even more after transitioning into a brand new engineering team; Business Application Support, led by Chad Wahid. This transition allowed myself and our engineers to contribute to more complex business efforts that weren't previously within our scope.

## Projects

### Rocket Logic Toolbox

Currently, Rocket Logic has an very large amount of Tier 1 support tickets that are going directly to Tier 2 and Tier 3 teams. RBI is unable to fully support Rocket Logic ticket requests, as there are no tools available to support RL at this level. With this application, 
we will have the capability to build tools that support Rocket Logic at the Tier 1 level. This will help enable Rocket Logic to focus on coding new technology and will expand Business Application Support's Rocket Logic knowledge as a Train.Throughtout the initial creation 
of the [RL Toolbox UI](https://git.rockfin.com/ShieldEngineering/RL-Toolbox-UI) and [RL Toolbox BFF](https://git.rockfin.com/ShieldEngineering/RL-Toolbox-BFF) I constantly had to adapt and learn various processes that our team was not yet familiar with, including: HAL 
utilization, Circle configs, authorization through bearer tokens, and API connectors.We are in the process of developing our first tool to help resolve tickets related to "Verification Mismatch" errors on first contact. Currently, there is a disconnect in the verification 
of client liabilities between AMP and Rocket Logic Credit Qualifier. Team members receive a verification mismatch status edit in AMP when attempting to change the loan status.

Below are some Pull Requests that are involved:

- [SQSService](https://git.rockfin.com/BusinessApplicationEngineering/RL-Toolbox-BFF/pull/25)

# Mentorship

## Software Engineering Mentorship with Chris Wilder

Shortly after my initial attempt at the CPA panel in early 2022, the Team Shield Mentorship program was implemented. My mentor, Chris Wilder, was a perfect selection for me, as he was able to provide insight on software engineering principles and processes that I was not quite familiar with, including REST API, Object-Oriented Programming, CICDs, AWS Terraform, and CircleCI.Overall, the mentorship program was a massive success. Chris and I continue to communicate frequently, and he has proven to be an incredibly valuable resourse for our team.## Embedding with Space Mountain"details about embedding with space mountain" - [DashDog (OpenAMP Health)](https://git.rockfin.com/OpenAMP/DashDog) - [Create Data Validation in HTTP Request Parameter for TrackingItem](https://git.rockfin.com/AMP/ampgate/pull/12047) - [QEToolsGateway Terraform](https://git.rockfin.com/OpenAMP/QEToolsGateway-tf) - [Create Endpoint for PageCount QE Tools](https://git.rockfin.com/AMP/ampgate/pull/12416) # Application Ownership - [QuickClock AMP Integration](https://apphub.rockettech.tools/applications/210556#general) - [MP Licensing of Loan Officers](https://apphub.rockettech.tools/applications/211775#general) - [Loan Status Insert Program](https://apphub.rockettech.tools/applications/212156#general) - [Treacking Item Framework](https://apphub.rockettech.tools/applications/212157#general) - [User Cascade Tool](https://apphub.rockettech.tools/applications/212165#general) - [Xbert](https://apphub.rockettech.tools/applications/200108#general) - [ORB](https://apphub.rockettech.tools/applications/201110#general)# Training"hackathon classes including the Capture the Flag event""design patterns book"# Opportunities "discuss opportunities from feedback using examples on how the feedback was implemented" - [RL Toolbox UI](https://git.rockfin.com/ShieldEngineering/RL-Toolbox-UI) - [RL Toolbox BFF](https://git.rockfin.com/ShieldEngineering/RL-Toolbox-BFF) - [AMPLoginMetrics - Hackweek](https://git.rockfin.com/OpenAMP/AMPLoginMetrics) - [DashDog (OpenAMP Health)](https://git.rockfin.com/OpenAMP/DashDog) - [QEToolsGateway Terraform](https://git.rockfin.com/OpenAMP/QEToolsGateway-tf) - [AMPLoginReport-UI - Hackweek](https://git.rockfin.com/OpenAMP/AMPLoginReport-UI)- <b>Pull Requests</b> - [Create Endpoint for PageCount QE Tools](https://git.rockfin.com/AMP/ampgate/pull/12416) - [Config Updates and LAA Implementations](https://git.rockfin.com/ShieldEngineering/RL-Toolbox-BFF/pull/3) - [Create a Report for Internal and External Audits](https://git.rockfin.com/AMP/ampgate/pull/8125) - [Create Data Validation in HTTP Request Parameter for Address API](https://git.rockfin.com/AMP/ampgate/pull/11096)- <b>Other Contributions</b> - [Create Data Validation in HTTP Request Parameter for TrackingItem](https://git.rockfin.com/AMP/ampgate/pull/12047) - [ORB SonicLog Adapter (TFS)](https://tfs.rockfin.com/QL/IT/_workitems/edit/2910733) - [Database Record Query](https://git.rockfin.com/AMP/ampgate/pull/10732)- <b>Application Ownership</b> - [QuickClock AMP Integration](https://apphub.rockettech.tools/applications/210556#general) - [MP Licensing of Loan Officers](https://apphub.rockettech.tools/applications/211775#general) - [Loan Status Insert Program](https://apphub.rockettech.tools/applications/212156#general) - [Treacking Item Framework](https://apphub.rockettech.tools/applications/212157#general) - [User Cascade Tool](https://apphub.rockettech.tools/applications/212165#general) - [Xbert](https://apphub.rockettech.tools/applications/200108#general) - [ORB](https://apphub.rockettech.tools/applications/201110#general)![image](https://git.rockfin.com/storage/user/4000/files/0e4fbdbe-d5c5-43d9-949f-659d45333b35)
